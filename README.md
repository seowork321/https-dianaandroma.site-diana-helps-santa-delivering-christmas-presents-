[It was Christmas Eve,](https://dianaandroma.site/diana-helps-santa-delivering-christmas-presents/) and Diana was so excited that she could hardly sleep. She had left cookies and milk out for Santa and was dreaming of all the presents she would find under the tree the next morning. But just as she was about to drift off to sleep, she heard a soft “ho-ho-ho” outside her window.
